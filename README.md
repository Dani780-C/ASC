# This is a small project in MIPS

**General Presentation of the Project**

The project follows the implementation of 5G networks based on Software Defined Network(SDN) arhitecture using MIPS. The general idea points to the inability of the level 2 and 3 equipment(Switches & Routers) to make logical decision, being exclusively at the discretion of a controller. In order to solve the problem, I implemented a graph algorithm that simulates the communication between all types of network hardware.
